\cvitem{}{ {\bfseries Member of the George Mitchell Scholarship's Young Irish Leaders.} \newline{}The George J. Mitchell Scholarship is an American scholarship program sponsored designed to introduce and connect generations of future American leaders to the island of Ireland. In 2006 the scholarship held its five year and all previous scholars were invited as well as an equal number of young Irish leaders including myself. We were brought together as a group to discuss major issues and areas of shared interest and how we could work together in the areas of Culture, Politics, Business, Science and Medicine. To date I continue as member of the Young Irish Leaders.}
