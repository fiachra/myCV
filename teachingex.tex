\cventry{2008}{Lecturer}{Engineering Dept.}{NUI Maynooth}{}{
As part of the Masters in Biomedical Engineering I development
and delivered course a new course entitled ``Applied Computing for
Engineers''. The aim of this module was to assist post-graduate
students in how to analyse and present data from a research
perspective. Students were taught how to use Matlab for data analysis,
Labview for hardware interfacing and Simulink for systems modelling.

\cventry{2007}{Lecturer}{Engineering Dept.}{NUI Maynooth}{}{
 I delivered a six lecture introduction to the theory and practice of digital signal processing (DSP) as part of the Masters in Biomenical Engeneering. This course was designed to help the student to quickly grasp fundamentals of DSP.  I also assisted the lecturer in setting suitable exam questions on this material.
