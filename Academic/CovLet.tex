\opening{Dear Ms. McCarthy}

I wish to apply for the assistant lecturer position in the Department
of Computer Science as advertised in the human resources website. I
have been involved in the department for over ten years including
my undergraduate and postgraduate studies as well as teaching.  I am
aware of most of the research projects currently under investigation
and I would welcome the opportunity to hold a full time position
there.

\noindent My attached CV contains the detail of my experience and I'm
very confident my skills will be complimentary to the department's
teaching requirements and its research direction. Over the last number
of years I have demonstrated for both computer science and
electronic engineering courses as well as lecturing and designing
teaching courses for both undergraduates and postgraduates.
 
My PhD has been in the area of biomedical-engineering. Specifically,
data collection, processing and analysis for optical brain computer
interfaces. My current role as a post-doc in the Robocup project
centres around developing complex software solutions to robotics
problems for competing in international competitions as well as team
management and coordination. 

My PhD has given me experience in hardware interfacing, advanced
signal processing, mathematical analysis, experimental design and user
interaction. My post-Doctoral position has allowed me to use these
skills to implement solutions within the area of robotics and given me
the experience of larger-scale collaborative software development,
student supervision and some administrative oversight of an SFI
project.

I would be eager to continue researching in biomedical-engineering and
robotics as well as applying these experiences to other projects.
Working in the Hamilton Institute and being part of a highly
interdisciplinary projects I have forged many collaborative
relationships throughout the university and abroad which I believe
will be a tremendous asset in any continued research.

\noindent I look forward to meeting you and discussing my
application. If you need any more information or if I can offer any
assistance in promoting my application please do not hesitate to
contact me on 086-8044914.



Sincerely Yours
