\section{EDUCATION}
\vspace{0.1in}
 
    {\bf Ph.D.}, Hamilton Institute, NUI Maynooth, Computer Science, (Due for submission May, 2009)

    {\bf Integrated Real-Time Control And Processing Systems For
    Multi-Channel Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Based Brain Computer
    Interfaces}.  \\Supervisors: Prof. Barak Pearlmutter \& Dr. Tomas
    Ward \\The project outlines the control and processing of an
    optical brain computer interface (BCI). It contributes new
    applications of signal processing and activation classification
    methods to the area of Near-infrared spectroscopy based BCIs.
    Some of the skills I acquired necessary to this project included:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Data processing and analysis
    \item Advanced signal processing methods
    \item Hardware synchronization
    \item Real-time systems development
    \end{itemize}

    Solutions were build in Matlab and C/C++ and a great deal of the
    interfacing was done with Labview. The project also involved
    spending some time researching and performing fMRI experiments in
    Rutgers University, New Jersey. Funded by SFI, this
    interdisciplinary project was run between the Dept. of Computer
    Science, Experimental Physics, Engineering and the Hamilton
    Institute. This project has so far 2 conference papers with 3 more
    in review and 2 journal papers including one in the IEEE Signal
    Processing Magazine.

    {\bf Primary Degree},  National University of Ireland, Maynooth, B.Sc.(Hons, 1$^{st}$ Class), 2005
    
    {\bf Computer Science and Software Engineering.}  \\A
    comprehensive computer science curriculum has been developed for
    this course based on the recommendations on computing curricula of
    the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of
    Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). It also includes a
    six month industrial work placement module and major final year
    project.

    {\bf Final Year Project}

    {\bf Development of a USB based goniometer for use as a platform
    for an inertial human motion tracking node}.\\ Supervisor:
    Dr. Charles Markham \\This project described an inertial
    goniometer based on solid-state technology, to be integrated into
    a larger system used for human motion tracking. The system was
    built around a micro-controller containing a USB interface. The
    project involved creating the API, application and user interfaces
    writing the firmware for the micro-controller and testing \&
    commissioning the hardware. This project won first prize in the
    Hewlett Packard Invent Award in 2005.
